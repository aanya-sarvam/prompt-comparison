"""Odia deed grounding / transcription prompts for Gemini.

LOCATE each known English metadata value on the page images, then TRANSCRIBE
it verbatim in the source script (Odia / Latin / mixed). Never translate or
invent glyphs.

Fields intentionally NOT sent as grounding targets (see OMITTED_TARGET_IDS):
  - registration_no
  - book_no / book number / book_label
  - listed_on   (wrong id — value is promoted to execution_date instead)

If metadata only has ``listed_on``, ``targets_from_tabular`` renames that
value to ``execution_date`` before building the prompt. Prefer setting
``execution_date`` explicitly when you already have it.

Deed category: {deed}. You are given {n_pages} page image(s) - {where}. For the "page" field, number the images 1..{n_pages} in THE ORDER SHOWN HERE (local to THIS request); do not use the deed's absolute page numbers.

You are given {n_pages} scanned page image(s) of ONE land deed, followed by a list of
METADATA FIELDS. Most fields carry a single known value in ENGLISH; a few (seller / buyer /
property) carry a SEMI-STRUCTURED LIST of several values (see LIST / COMPOSITE FIELDS below).
The English value(s) are used only to LOCATE text. Your task is to FIND where each value
appears in the images and TRANSCRIBE the exact text as written there, IN THE SAME SCRIPT the
page uses.

============================ CORE PRINCIPLE ============================
LOCATE, then TRANSCRIBE VERBATIM IN THE SOURCE SCRIPT. The English value only tells you WHAT
to look for; it is NOT the answer and NOT the format. Copy the exact ink on the page:
  - if the page writes the value in Odia  -> transcribe the Odia glyphs,
  - if the page writes the value only in English/Latin -> transcribe those English/Latin
    characters exactly as printed.
Ground truth = what is physically on the page, in its own script. Never translate, never
transliterate the English into Odia yourself, and never invent a spelling that is not there.

============================ HOW TO MATCH ==============================
- NAMES (person/relation): the English is a transliteration. Find the matching word on the
  page and copy it exactly - Odia glyphs if written in Odia (e.g. "SUHANI" -> ସୁହାନୀ), or the
  Latin form if the deed only prints it in English (e.g. "SUHANI" -> Suhani). Names can
  legitimately have more than one valid transliteration/spelling for the SAME person (e.g.
  "ASHOK" vs "ASOK", "TRIPATHY" vs "TRIPATHI", "DEBI" vs "DEVI"). Do not reject a match just
  because the spelling differs letter-for-letter from the database's transliteration; if the
  on-page name is a recognizable spelling/transliteration variant of the same person, treat it
  as a match, transcribe what is on the page, and note the spelling difference in "notes"
  rather than marking not found. Only mark not found if the name on the page genuinely belongs
  to a DIFFERENT person (see ONE FIELD = ONE ENTITY below), not merely a different spelling of
  the same one.
- PLACE NAMES (village / AT / PO / PS / district): copy the on-page spelling in its script.
  The database's anglicized spelling and the page's own spelling of the SAME place can
  legitimately differ (e.g. "BERHAMPUR" in the metadata vs "Brahmapur" written on the page -
  same town, different anglicization convention). Do not reject a match just because the
  spellings differ letter-for-letter; if the on-page place name is a recognizable spelling
  variant / alternate transliteration of the same place, treat it as a match, transcribe what
  is on the page, and note the spelling difference in "notes" rather than marking not found.
  Only mark not found if the place named on the page is actually a DIFFERENT place, not merely
  a different spelling of the same one.
  VILLAGE/PROPERTY SERIAL NUMBERS: village or property names are often followed by a number on
  the page itself (e.g. a mouza/plot serial like "-37", "-153") - if that number genuinely
  appears next to the village name in the ink, INCLUDE it in your transcription exactly as
  written; do not drop it or play it safe by leaving it out. Only omit the number if the page
  truly does not show one there (in that case do not invent it just because english_value has
  a trailing number) - the rule cuts both ways: transcribe what's on the page, whether that
  includes a number or not.
- DEED TYPE / RELATION words: copy the term as written, INCLUDING short forms actually on the
  page (e.g. ପି:/ପିତା for father, ସ୍ୱା:/ସ୍ତ୍ରୀ for spouse, ଉଇଲ for WILL). Do not expand an
  abbreviation that is written short.
- DEED TYPE (id "deed_type") IS SPECIAL - do not apply strict verbatim-match or the GENERIC
  placeholder rule to it. Unlike other fields, deed_type is a DATABASE CATEGORY LABEL, not a
  proper noun the page necessarily repeats: the page almost always carries SOME deed-category
  term near the top / in the title, even when the assigned english_value is a catch-all like
  "OTHER DEED"/"MISC", or does not lexically match the page's own heading (e.g. english_value
  "RECONVEYANCE OF MORTGAGE" but the page reads "Continuing Mortgage Bond"). In BOTH cases:
  still locate the page's own deed-category term near the top and TRANSCRIBE it verbatim
  (Odia glyphs if that's the script used), set "found": true, and note the mismatch in
  "notes" (e.g. "page's own label differs from assigned category"). Only set "found": false
  for deed_type if there is truly no deed-category heading/term anywhere on the page.
- NUMBERS, AMOUNTS, DATES: transcribe VERBATIM in whatever script the page uses. Odia digits
  (୦୧୨୩୪୫୬୭୮୯) stay Odia; Arabic digits (0-9) stay Arabic; words stay words. NEVER convert
  between numeral systems and never reformat separators (keep dots/slashes/hyphens exactly,
  e.g. ୨୬.୪.୮୮ or 26-4-88 as shown).
- EXECUTION DATE (id "execution_date"): this is the date the deed was EXECUTED / signed by
  the parties (often near the executant signatures or the opening body), NOT the registration
  stamp date and NOT the presentation/endorsement date. Do not confuse it with registration
  or presentation dates when those also appear on the page.
- REGISTRATION DATE vs PRESENTATION DATE (ids "registration_date" / "presentation_date"): these
  are TWO DIFFERENT DATES and are usually DIFFERENT VALUES - do not report the same date for
  both unless the page genuinely shows the same date stamped in both places.
    - "presentation_date" = the date the deed was PRESENTED / submitted for registration
      (usually the EARLIER date, often near a "presented on" / ଉପସ୍ଥାପିତ endorsement).
    - "registration_date" = the date the deed was actually REGISTERED / copied (usually the
      LATER date, near the registrar's registration/copying endorsement, often on a different
      page or a different line from the presentation stamp).
  Locate EACH one at its own distinct endorsement/stamp on the page - do not simply reuse
  whichever date you found first for both fields. If you can only find one endorsement clearly,
  do not guess the other from it; mark the one you cannot independently verify as not found
  rather than duplicating the other field's value.

===================== SOURCE-SCRIPT FIDELITY (script) =================
Record which script you actually transcribed, in "script":
  - "odia"  : you copied Odia-script glyphs from the page.
  - "latin" : the value is written only in English/Latin on the page and you copied that.
  - "mixed" : the single value genuinely contains both scripts together.
If the SAME value appears in BOTH scripts on the page, prefer the Odia rendering (set
"script":"odia") and mention in "notes" that an English form also exists. Copying English that
IS on the page is correct and expected for English deeds; inventing Odia that is NOT on the
page is always wrong.

======================= ONE FIELD = ONE ENTITY ========================
Deeds list several people (first party, second party, relations, boundary owners). Make sure
the text you return belongs to the SPECIFIC field asked for, in the SAME row/clause as its
label. Do NOT grab a similar word belonging to a different person or a different plot. If two
people share a name, use position/context to pick the correct one.

================= LIST / COMPOSITE FIELDS (seller / buyer / property) =========
Some fields are NOT a single value but a SEMI-STRUCTURED LIST describing several people or
plots, given in a compact database format (the field also carries a "format" hint). Examples:
  seller_details / buyer_details ("type":"party_list"):
    "1-<NAME>  ( RELATION : )<REL>  ( RELATION NAME : )<GUARDIAN>  ( ADDRESS : )<ADDR> ,2-<NAME> ..."
  property_details ("type":"property_list"):
    "1- Village : <V>  Khata : <K> Plot : <P> Area: <A> Total Area: <TA> Boundary : <B> ,2- ..."
For each LIST field:
  1. SPLIT it into its numbered items (1-, 2-, 3-, ...).
  2. DE-DUPLICATE identical items: if two or more numbered items are effectively identical -
     for parties the SAME name (and same relation_name/address), for property the SAME
     village+khata+plot+area - they are a single real entity that the database accidentally
     repeated. Collapse them into ONE item and emit its sub-values only ONCE (item_index 1).
     Never emit the same value twice merely because the input listed it twice. Keep items
     separate ONLY when they genuinely describe DIFFERENT people or DIFFERENT plots.
  3. For every (de-duplicated) item, pull out the meaningful sub-values it contains - for
     parties: the person NAME, the RELATION NAME (guardian/father/spouse name), the ADDRESS;
     for property: the VILLAGE, KHATA, PLOT, AREA. (The relation TYPE word like "Others" is a
     generic label - skip it; see GENERIC below.)
  4. Then, exactly as for a scalar field, LOCATE each sub-value on the page and TRANSCRIBE it
     verbatim in the source script.
Emit ONE result object PER SUB-VALUE you attempt, setting:
  - "id"            = the list field's id (e.g. "seller_details") - repeated across its rows,
  - "item_index"    = which numbered item it came from (1, 2, ...),
  - "attr"          = the sub-value: "name" | "relation_name" | "address" | "village" |
                      "khata" | "plot" | "area",
  - "english_value" = the EXACT sub-string you took from the input for that attr,
  - plus found / odia_text / script / page / confidence / latin_readback / notes as usual.
Skip sub-values that are empty or generic; do not emit a row for a person/plot that has no
usable sub-value. For a normal SCALAR field, return exactly ONE row with "item_index": 0,
"attr": "" and "english_value" set to the single value you were given.

================= GENERIC / NON-SPECIFIC ENGLISH VALUES ================
Some english_value entries are generic database placeholders, not real words to search for -
e.g. "Others", "NA", "N/A", "Nil", "-", or blank. These give you no phonetic or semantic anchor,
so you CANNOT reliably verify a specific matching word on the page against them. For such
fields, ALWAYS set "found": false, "odia_text": "", "script": "", with "notes": "english_value
is a generic placeholder ('Others'/'NA'/etc.), cannot be verified against a specific word".
This applies with NO exception to "type": "relation_word" fields: even though there is usually
ONE relation marker (e.g. ପି:/ସ୍ୱା:) written next to that person's name, do NOT report it when
english_value is a generic placeholder - the database gave you no way to confirm WHICH relation
it intended, so any specific marker you pick is an unverifiable guess, not a located match.

======================= PAGE PROVENANCE (page) =======================
For EVERY field you locate you MUST record WHICH PAGE it came from, because this
mapping is used downstream to train a page-aware model. In "page" put the 1-based
number of the image (counting in the exact order the page images were given to you
in THIS request) on which the value physically appears.
  - found=true  -> "page" MUST be a real page number >= 1 (never 0).
  - found=false -> "page" = 0.
  - if the same value appears on several pages, report the page of the single
    clearest, most complete occurrence (the same one you transcribed).
Do not guess a page you did not actually read the value from; the page number must
point to where the transcribed text really is.

===================== WHEN YOU CANNOT FIND IT =========================
If the value is genuinely not visible in ANY script (absent, torn, fully illegible), set
"found": false, "odia_text": "", "script": "", "page": 0, "confidence": 0.0, and say why in
"notes". NEVER guess, never fabricate, never approximate from the English. A truthful "not
found" is better than a wrong transcription.

=========================== SELF-CHECK ================================
Before finalizing each field, fill "latin_readback" with a Latin reading of "odia_text" (for
Odia, your phonetic transliteration; for a value already in Latin, repeat it), and compare it
to english_value:
  - If they clearly match in sound/meaning -> keep it, confidence high.
  - If they do NOT match -> you likely located the wrong text; re-scan, fix it, or mark not
    found. Do not report text whose readback contradicts the English.
DATES specifically: if "odia_text" is a date WRITTEN IN WORDS (e.g. Odia spelling out
day/month/year rather than digits), still transcribe those words verbatim in "odia_text" -
but make "latin_readback" the INTERPRETED numeric date (e.g. "26-2-2003"), not a syllable-by-
syllable phonetic spelling of the words (e.g. NOT "chhabisi tarikha phebruari..."). The
readback's job here is to let you (and the self-check) verify you read the date correctly
against english_value; a phonetic-only transliteration of date-words cannot be checked against
a numeric date and defeats that purpose.

============================= OUTPUT =================================
Rules:
1. Copy character-for-character: preserve every matra (vowel sign), conjunct, nukta and space.
2. Set "script" to "odia" / "latin" / "mixed" to match what you transcribed (see above).
3. "page" = 1-based index of the image (in the order given) where the text appears -
   REQUIRED for every found field (>= 1); use 0 only when found=false. See PAGE PROVENANCE.
4. "confidence" (0.0-1.0): calibrate honestly - high only when the characters are clear AND the
   readback matches the English; lower it for faint/handwritten/ambiguous cases.
5. If a value appears more than once, report the single clearest, most complete occurrence.
6. SCALAR fields: return each id EXACTLY once ("item_index":0, "attr":""). LIST fields
   (seller/buyer/property): return ONE object per located sub-value - the same id repeated,
   distinguished by "item_index" + "attr". Output ONLY a JSON array matching the schema,
   nothing else.
